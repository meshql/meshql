# MeshQL Roadmap — from 0.1.x to ORM integration

> A phased plan to take MeshQL from "v0.1 prototype with a Postgres SQL helper"
> to "drop-in REST middleware with field selection, integrity, native uploads,
> and ORM-driven schemas." Optimised for a single maintainer working
> ~8–10 hours/week.
>
> Historical milestone sections retain the API names that shipped at the time.
> `$list` and version negotiation were superseded before the current release;
> see `specs/05-read-controls.md` for the active query contract.
>
> **Active client/wire contract:** every JSON read node uses `$select`;
> controls (`$where`, `$orderBy`, `$page`, …) live on that same node.
> `client.query(query, { entityId? })` accepts that object directly — there is
> no separate selection map or controls options bag. See
> `docs/src/content/docs/reference/query-controls.md`.

## Vision

A developer should be able to wire MeshQL into an Express app in ten lines and
get a field-selecting REST API backed by their existing ORM, with cryptographic
request integrity and native multipart uploads:

```ts
import express from "express";
import { createMesh } from "meshql-core";
import { meshExpressRouter } from "meshql-http/express";
import { withIntegrity } from "meshql-integrity";
import { withUpload } from "meshql-upload";
import { prismaResolver, schemaFromPrisma } from "meshql-prisma";
import { prisma } from "./db.js";

const schema = await schemaFromPrisma("./prisma/schema.prisma");
const mesh = createMesh(schema);
withIntegrity(mesh, { secret: process.env.SECRET, authenticate });
withUpload(mesh, { storage: "s3", bucket: "uploads" });
mesh.resolve("*", prismaResolver(prisma));

express()
  .use(express.json())
  .use(meshExpressRouter(mesh, "/api"))
  .listen(3000);
```

Every gap between this snippet and what the repo does today is a roadmap item.

## Status (as of 0.9.x)

**Current sequence** — Phase 1 landed first (correctness took precedence over
repositioning), then the chosen execution order is:

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | Cut **0.2.0** with the Phase 1 correctness fixes | ✅ |
| B | CI Postgres integration test (was item 1.10) | ✅ |
| C | **Phase 0** — split `@meshql/postgres` + `@meshql/sqlite` out of `@meshql/core` | ✅ (shipped in 0.2.0) |
| D | **Phase 2** — `JoinPlan.list`, filters, cursors, catch-all resolver | ✅ |
| E | Decide on **Phase 4.5** wire protocol work (persisted queries / compression / CBOR) — placement and timing | ✅ scoped to **0.8.0** (persisted queries; CBOR deferred) |
| F | **Phase 3** — native multipart uploads with signed body | ✅ (0.5.0) |
| G | Showcase blog app (`examples/showcase`) | ✅ |
| H | Multi-level nested fields | ✅ (0.5.1) |
| I | **Phase 4** — ORM adapters (Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely) | ✅ (0.6.0) |
| J | **Phase 5** — `schemaFromPrisma` / `schemaFromDrizzle` / `extendSchema` | ✅ (0.7.0) |
| K | **Slice B** — shaper `shapeRefMany` O(N²)→O(N) + `makeFieldReader` hot-loop caching | ✅ (0.7.1) |
| L | Language-agnostic **protocol specs** + conformance fixtures (`specs/`, docs.meshql.dev/specs) | ✅ |
| M | **FAQ** on docs site + list `$list` field validation (no cross-entity filter/orderBy) | ✅ (0.7.1) |
| N | **`@meshql/docs`** — interactive playground + schema introspection middleware | ✅ ready (0.10.0) |
| O | **Canonical JSON query** — `$select` required; client emits the wire shape; no shorthand / separate controls bag | ✅ |
| P | **Computed fields in `@meshql/core`** — virtual fields, dependency expansion, access integration, guide + spec | ✅ implemented |

Phases 3 → 5 follow the original order. The headline plan below describes
the *intended* phase progression; the Status table is the source of truth for
*actual* sequencing through 0.x.

### This week (ship before v0.8.0 work)

Focus shifts from polish to expand — docs and protocol specs are done. These are
quick wins with outsized impact:

| Priority | Item | Why now | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **Docs SEO** — add `meta name="description"` to docs.meshql.dev | Other mesh projects drown out MeshQL in Google; fix discoverability | ✅ done |
| **P1** | **Fix stale SQLite README** — `express-postgres` still says "SQLite is not supported" | Embarrassing if someone finds it; `@meshql/sqlite` is first-class | ✅ done |
| **P2** | **Fix release CI** — tag push must trigger `publish-jsr` / `publish-npm` | Blocks every release until fixed | ✅ done |
| **P3** | **Schema naming polish** — `console.warn` at `createMesh()` for irregular plurals without `table:` | Cheap footgun fix before 0.8 | ✅ done |

### v0.8.0 — Performance & production wire protocol

Must ship. Biggest perf and trust gaps for production adopters.

| Priority | Item | Notes | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **`@meshql/persisted-queries`** | Register query → get ID; `X-Mesh-Query-Id: q_a3f1` (10 bytes vs ~300); biggest production perf win; solves large-query header limits | ✅ shipped (0.8.0) |
| **P1** | **`@meshql/access-cache`** | Redis / Upstash / in-memory; cache permission results per user; 60s default TTL; manual invalidation API | ✅ shipped (0.8.0) |
| **P1** | **Core test coverage** | Parser, planner, shaper — conformance fixtures, sql-from-plan, error paths (158 tests in `@meshql/core`) | ✅ shipped (0.8.0) |
| **P2** | **`examples/express-drizzle`** | Parity with express-prisma, inferred schema | deferred |
| **P3** | **More demos** — `fastify-drizzle`, `hono-kysely` (edge/SQLite) | deferred |

Deferred from old Phase 4.5 plan: compression / optional CBOR — revisit after
persisted queries land.

### v0.9.0 — Real-time & federation

| Priority | Item | Notes | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **`@meshql/pubsub`** | Memory, Redis, Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY | ✅ shipped (0.9.0) |
| **P0** | **`@meshql/sse`** | Field-aware SSE subscriptions; Express adapter | ✅ shipped (0.9.0) |
| **P1** | **`@meshql/gateway` V1** | Federated multi-service queries; static service config; parallel fetch + stitch | ✅ shipped (0.1.0) |
| **P1** | **`@meshql/codemods`** | GraphQL SDL → MeshQL schema; migration report + CLI | ✅ shipped (0.1.0) |
| **P1** | **Showcase SSE demo** | React live updates via pubsub + signed SSE | ✅ shipped |
| **P1** | **SSE Fastify/Hono adapters** | Parity with `@meshql/http` | ✅ shipped (sse 0.2.x) |
| **P2** | **API audit** | Mark internals, freeze public surface heading into 1.0 | 1 week |
| **P2** | **Security pass** | Replay nonces/timestamps, threat-model doc (complements v1.0 integrity audit) | 1 week |

### v0.10.0 — Developer experience (`@meshql/docs`)

> Swagger UI / GraphQL Playground — but for MeshQL. One line enables an
> interactive schema browser and query runner at `/docs` on the user's server.
> Biggest adoption lever before 1.0: evaluators can see what MeshQL does
> without writing code.

**Build first.** Computed fields (0.11) enhance the playground but docs
ships standalone value on the existing schema.

| Priority | Item | Notes | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **Core: `PluginContext.plan` + `ExecuteOptions.trace`** | Attach `JoinPlan` to plugin context; optional SQL trace collector for postgres/sqlite resolvers | 3 days |
| **P0** | **`@meshql/docs` — schema introspection** | `GET /docs/schema` → `SchemaDoc` JSON from `mesh.schema` (entities, fields, joins); not a `__schema` query | 3 days |
| **P0** | **`@meshql/docs` — execute proxy** | `POST /docs/execute` → `mesh.execute()` with request context; returns `{ data, meta: { durationMs, plan?, sql? } }` | 2 days |
| **P0** | **Playground UI** | Self-contained SPA bundled in package: entity browser, click-to-build query, live response panel, join-plan visualization | 2 weeks |
| **P0** | **SQL trace panel (dev mode)** | `sql: "dev"` shows actual SQL + params; killer differentiator vs GraphQL Playground | 2 days |
| **P1** | **Framework adapters** | `@meshql/docs/express`, `/fastify`, `/hono` — same pattern as `@meshql/http` | 2 days |
| **P1** | **Showcase `/docs` demo** | Wire `examples/showcase` — live eval path for adopters | 2 days |
| **P1** | **Docs site package page** | `docs.meshql.dev/packages/docs` + guide page | 2 days |
| **P2** | **Integrity-aware playground** | When `withIntegrity` is enabled, docs UI signs requests via `@meshql/client` | 3 days |

**Public API:**

```ts
import { withDocs } from "@meshql/docs";

withDocs(mesh, {
  path: "/docs",
  title: "My API",
  theme: "dark",
  auth: false,          // or "admin" | (ctx) => boolean
  sql: "dev",           // show SQL panel; default false in production
});
```

**Routes:**

```
GET  /docs              → static SPA (embedded in package)
GET  /docs/schema       → JSON introspection
POST /docs/execute      → run query (delegates to mesh.execute)
```

**Security defaults:** warn when `auth: false` in production; never expose raw
`columns` / table mappings unless `sql: "dev"`.

**Package:** `@meshql/docs` (JSR) · `meshql-docs` (npm). See [Phase 6](#phase-6--meshqldocs-interactive-playground-4-weeks).

### v0.11.0 — Computed fields (in `@meshql/core`)

> Virtual fields that don't exist in the DB but are computed on the fly from
> real fields. Client asks for `{ user { fullName } }`; planner fetches
> `firstName` + `lastName`; core applies `compute` before shaping.

**Implemented schema-natively in core** — no separate `@meshql/computed`
package. Playground introspection identifies computed fields and exposes their
optional runtime type hint; dependency tooltips remain future polish.

| Priority | Item | Notes | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **Schema cleanup: remove `EntityConfig.type`** | Drop the compile-time-only placeholder from core, generated schemas, tests, and docs before the computed API extends `EntityConfig` | ✅ done |
| **P0** | **Schema types in core** | `ComputedFieldDef` on `EntityConfig`; computed names queryable without listing in `fields` | ✅ done |
| **P0** | **Planner dep expansion** | Requested computed field → expand `from` deps into `plan.fields`; computed name excluded from SQL | ✅ done |
| **P0** | **Core execute path** | Flat + preshaped: inject/apply computed; strip unrequested source deps | ✅ done |
| **P0** | **Access integration** | Denied computed field stripped at planner; unrequested source deps never fetched | ✅ done |
| **P1** | **Cross-entity computed** | `from: ["customer.firstName"]` auto-adds customer join | ✅ done |
| **P1** | **ORM preshaped path** | Prisma/Drizzle nested results — compute after resolver, before response | ✅ done (preshaped) |
| **P1** | **Spec `08-computed-fields.md`** | Portable computed-field behavior contract | ✅ done |
| **P2** | **Docs integration** | Guide + spec + `kind: "computed"` introspection; dependency tooltip remains | ✅ core docs done |

**Public API:**

```ts
const mesh = createMesh({
  entities: {
    user: {
      fields: ["id", "firstName", "lastName"],
      computed: {
        fullName: {
          from: ["firstName", "lastName"],
          compute: (deps) => `${deps.firstName ?? ""} ${deps.lastName ?? ""}`.trim(),
          type: "string",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  joins: {},
});
```

Access control stays in `@meshql/access` (`"user.fullName": …`).

**v1 limitations (document explicitly):**

- Computed fields not available in `$where` / `$orderBy`
- Computed depending on computed → registration error
- Sync `compute` only; async deferred to v1.x
- Gateway / cross-service computed deferred

See [Phase 7](#phase-7--computed-fields-in-meshqlcore-35-weeks).

### v1.0.0 — Stability contract

Non-negotiables for the 1.0 cut:

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Zero breaking changes** from 0.11 → 1.0 | Semver freeze starts here |
| **`@meshql` npm org resolved** | Migrate `meshql-*` → `@meshql/*` cleanly |
| **Security audit of `@meshql/integrity`** | External or structured self-audit with published findings |
| **Performance benchmarks published** | vs GraphQL + dataloaders — numbers, not claims (`measure-shaper.mjs` is the seed) |
| **Auth adapters** | `@meshql/auth-clerk`, `@meshql/auth-auth0`, `@meshql/auth-jwt` |
| **Go port planning started** | Spec already published ✅; find Go maintainer; placeholder repo |

## Goals (v1.0 scope)

- Database-agnostic via the resolver pattern + first-party ORM adapters
- REST-native: URLs, methods, multipart bodies — no GraphQL ceremony
- Cryptographic request integrity (one-way keys, expiring tokens, signed bodies)
- Drop-in Express middleware; Fastify and Hono ports kept in lockstep
- Schema can be hand-written or inferred from an ORM
- Real list endpoints: pagination, filtering, ordering, cursors
- Native file upload signed end-to-end
- Opt-in interactive API playground (`@meshql/docs`) with SQL trace in dev mode
- Virtual / computed fields (in `@meshql/core`) with access-control integration

## Non-goals (v1.0)

- WebSocket subscriptions (SSE ships in 0.9; full duplex deferred)
- Owning a SQL builder for every database — the resolver layer is the abstraction
- Custom mutation verbs beyond entity CRUD — defer to a plugin in v1.x
- A standalone GraphiQL clone or browser-side schema editor
- `__schema` introspection query in the MeshQL wire protocol (use `@meshql/docs` HTTP route instead)
- Gateway / cross-service computed fields

---

## Phase 0 — Repositioning (1 evening) ✅ DONE

> Stop describing MeshQL as a SQL-building library. The Postgres helper becomes
> one of many adapters. This is a *messaging* change with a small code move.
>
> **Note**: Originally scheduled first; Phase 1 ran ahead because the
> correctness bugs were blocking real-world use. Phase 0 then expanded to
> ship **two** first-class adapters simultaneously — see "Why two adapters"
> below.
>
> **What landed in 0.3.0**:
>
> - `@meshql/postgres` (new): `buildSelectSql` with `$1, $2, …` placeholders
>   plus the Postgres integration test moved here from `@meshql/core`.
> - `@meshql/sqlite` (new): `buildSelectSql` with `?` placeholders, designed
>   for Node 22.5+'s built-in `node:sqlite`. End-to-end tests against
>   `:memory:` run in the fast `pnpm test` suite — no Docker required.
> - `@meshql/core` no longer exports SQL helpers. Breaking change documented
>   in `.changeset/phase-0-repositioning.md` with a migration snippet.
> - `examples/express-postgres` switched import to `@meshql/postgres`.
> - `examples/express-sqlite` (new): drop-in companion example that boots in
>   ~3s with zero infrastructure.
>
> **Why two adapters now (not just one)**: with only Postgres in the
> picture, "DB-agnostic" is unverified marketing. Shipping two first-party
> adapters with identical APIs but divergent placeholder strategies forces
> the abstraction to be real on day one. Cost: ~30 LOC of duplication in
> the builder. Benefit: SQLite users can run MeshQL in 5 seconds with zero
> setup, and Phase 4 (ORMs) inherits a proven contract.

### Tasks

1. Create `packages/postgres/` with the same layout as other packages
   (`src/`, `tsup.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `jsr.json`,
   `CHANGELOG.md`). Publishes as `meshql-postgres` / `@meshql/postgres`.
2. Move `packages/core/src/sql/*` → `packages/postgres/src/`.
3. Drop the `buildSelectSql` re-exports from `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
4. Update `examples/express-postgres/src/server.ts` to import from
   `@meshql/postgres`.
5. **(Expanded)** Create `packages/sqlite/` mirroring the Postgres layout.
   Builder emits `?` placeholders. Targets Node 22.5+'s `node:sqlite`.
6. **(Expanded)** Create `examples/express-sqlite/` — drop-in example that
   needs no infrastructure (uses `:memory:`).
7. Rewrite the README:
   - New tagline: *"DB-agnostic REST middleware with field selection,
     integrity, and uploads — drop it into Express."*
   - Hero code block: the 10-line snippet from the Vision section (mark
     `prismaResolver` and `schemaFromPrisma` as *coming in 0.6/0.7*).
   - Move the SQL-builder example to a "Helpers — Postgres / SQLite"
     section near the bottom, after the Express drop-in.
8. Add a changeset documenting the breaking move for anyone importing
   `buildSelectSql` from `@meshql/core`.

### Acceptance

- `pnpm build && pnpm test` both clean.
- README's first runnable code block is the resolver-first drop-in.
- `pnpm publish:npm:pack` produces `meshql-postgres-0.2.0-*.tgz`.

### Notes

This is intentionally cheap. Doing it first prevents every subsequent task from
being framed against the wrong mental model.

---

## Phase 1 — Correctness foundation (2 weeks) ✅ DONE

> Make the engine correct on the cases the existing tests don't cover. Without
> this nothing else matters.
>
> **All items below are landed in 0.2.0.** See
> `.changeset/phase-1-correctness.md` for the release notes.

### 1.1 Schema gets `idField` ✅

`packages/core/src/schema/schema.ts`:

```ts
export interface EntityConfig {
  fields: string[];
  idField?: string;       // default "id"
  table?: string;
  columns?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

`idField` is the authoritative way to identify a row for shaping, deduping, and
cursor pagination. The shaper uses it instead of guessing.

### 1.2 Fix the shaper Cartesian-product bug ✅

Today, a query with two `many` joins produces `count(a) × count(b)` flat rows
and the shaper duplicates each nested record. Rewrite
`packages/core/src/shaper/shaper.ts`:

- For each `many` ref, group the rows by that ref's `idField` and emit one
  nested record per unique id.
- For each `one` ref, take the first non-null match.
- If every row's ref columns are null (left join with no match), emit `[]` for
  `many` and `null` for `one`.

### 1.3 Fix `shapeMany` root grouping ✅

Stop falling back to `node.fields[0]` when `id` isn't requested. Use the
schema's `idField`. Project the id column internally even if the client didn't
request it, and strip it from the output before returning.

### 1.4 Remove `handleDelete` (or wire it up) ✅

`packages/http/src/handlers/index.ts:68` currently returns a hardcoded
`{ deleted: true, … }` without calling any resolver. Either:

- **Drop the DELETE route** for v0.2 (recommended — no real mutation story yet).
- Or add `mesh.delete(entity, resolver)` to the registry and route DELETE
  requests through it.

Prefer dropping it. Add it back in a later phase along with PATCH/POST
mutations as part of the CRUD story.

### 1.5 Quote SQL aliases in `@meshql/postgres` ✅

`AS "tokens_accessToken"` instead of `AS tokens_accessToken`. Added in
`@meshql/core` (the SQL builder hasn't moved out yet — see Phase 0).
Regression guard lives in
`packages/core/src/sql/builder.integration.test.ts`.

### 1.6 Plugin runner cleanup ✅

`packages/core/src/plugin/runner.ts`:

- Remove the dead `isPlanShortCircuit(result) ? plan : result` branch
  inside `runOnPlan` — once a short-circuit fires the loop returns.
- Add a comment documenting the onion ordering
  (`onRequest`/`onPlan` forward, `onResult`/`onResponse` reverse).

### 1.7 Rate-limit cleanup ✅

`packages/core/src/builtins/plugins/rate-limit.ts`:

- Remove the unused module-level `stores` map.
- Decide explicitly whether multiple `rateLimit()` instances share state
  (probably not — keep per-instance).
- Document the choice in a JSDoc comment.

### 1.8 Real `RateLimitError` class ✅

`packages/core/src/errors/index.ts`:

```ts
export class RateLimitError extends MeshError {
  constructor(message: string, public readonly retryAfterMs?: number) {
    super(message, "RateLimitError", retryAfterMs ? { retryAfterMs } : undefined);
  }
}
```

Update `packages/http/src/index.ts` to map by `instanceof RateLimitError`,
not by string-matching `error.code === "RateLimitError"`. Same audit for the
other error codes.

### 1.9 Tests to add ✅

`packages/core/src/shaper/shaper.test.ts` — five new cases:

- Two `many` joins on the same root: `2 tokens × 2 roles = 4 input rows →
  2 tokens + 2 roles` in output.
- Left join with no match: emits `[]` for `many`, `null` for `one`.
- `shapeMany` with mixed-cardinality joins across multiple root records.
- Root entity without an `idField` declared falls back to `"id"`.
- Schema declares `idField: "uuid"` — shaper uses it.

`packages/core/src/sql/builder.test.ts` → moved to `packages/postgres/`:

- Aliases are quoted.
- Mixed-case columns round-trip through real Postgres (integration test).
- Composite `WHERE` with multiple `entityId` lookups.

### 1.10 CI integration test matrix ✅

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` now has two jobs:

- `build-and-test` — existing fast unit suite + typecheck + build (excludes
  `*.integration.test.ts` via `pnpm test`'s vitest filter).
- `integration` — spins up a Postgres 16 service container and runs
  `pnpm test:integration`, which currently exercises
  `packages/core/src/sql/builder.integration.test.ts`.

The integration test will move to `packages/postgres/` during Phase 0; the
workflow stays the same since `test:integration` is a top-level turbo task.

Local usage:

```bash
docker run -d --rm --name meshql-pg -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=meshql -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=meshql \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=meshql_test postgres:16
DATABASE_URL=postgres://meshql:meshql@localhost:5432/meshql_test \
  pnpm test:integration
```

### Acceptance

- All five new shaper test cases pass.
- Postgres integration test passes in CI.
- `pnpm test` finishes in <10s; integration tests in <60s.
- Changeset entries for each fix.

**Release: 0.2.0** (breaking: `idField` schema addition is non-breaking with a
default; SQL builder move is breaking. Document both in the changeset.)

---

## Phase 2 — JoinPlan extensions + catch-all resolver (1.5 weeks) ✅ DONE

> Make list endpoints real. Plumb pagination, filtering, ordering down to the
> resolver. Add the catch-all resolver pattern that ORM adapters will rely on.
>
> **What landed in 0.4.0** (historical API names):
>
> - `JoinPlan.list` with `ListOptions` (limit, cursor, orderBy, filter).
> - List metadata travels in the signed JSON wire payload as `$list` — not URL
>   query strings — so pagination and filters stay inside the integrity boundary.
> - Catch-all resolver via `mesh.resolve("*", fn)`; specific resolvers win.
> - `@meshql/postgres` and `@meshql/sqlite` builders generate parameterized
>   `WHERE`/`ORDER BY`/`LIMIT` and keyset cursor predicates; `encodeCursor` /
>   `decodeCursor` helpers exported from both adapters.
> - `@meshql/client` accepts a `list` option that serializes `$list` into the
>   signed `X-Mesh-Query` header automatically.
>
> **Superseded:** `$list` and `client.query(selection, { list })` were replaced
> by per-node `$select` / `$where` / `$orderBy` / `$page` (and related controls).
> Active contract: `specs/05-read-controls.md` and
> `client.query({ user: { $select: …, $page: … } }, { entityId? })`.

### 2.1 Extend `JoinPlan` with `list`

`packages/core/src/planner/join-plan.ts`:

```ts
export interface JoinPlan {
  rootEntity: string;
  fields: string[];
  joins: ResolvedJoin[];
  context: QueryContext;
  list?: ListOptions;
}

export interface ListOptions {
  limit?: number;          // default 50, max 200
  cursor?: string;         // opaque base64 cursor
  orderBy?: OrderBy[];     // multi-key
  filter?: Filter[];
}

export interface OrderBy {
  field: string;
  dir: "asc" | "desc";
}

export type FilterOp =
  | "eq" | "ne" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte"
  | "in" | "nin" | "like" | "ilike";

export interface Filter {
  field: string;
  op: FilterOp;
  value: unknown;
}
```

`list` is set when the wire payload includes `$list`, when the caller passes
`listOptions` to `mesh.execute()`, or when the HTTP route is a list read (no
`:id` segment) and list metadata is present in the signed query.

*(Historical `JoinPlan.list` / `$list` surface — current plans carry normalized
controls on `plan.read` instead.)*

### 2.2 List metadata in the signed wire payload ✅

MeshQL carries queries in `X-Mesh-Query` (base64 JSON), not URL query strings.
In 0.4.0, list options were a `$list` sibling key so they stayed under request
signing. **Current wire shape** (post–read-controls rewrite):

```json
{
  "user": {
    "$select": { "id": true, "name": true },
    "$page": { "first": 20, "after": "opaque-cursor" },
    "$orderBy": [{ "field": "createdAt", "direction": "desc" }],
    "$where": { "field": "role", "op": "in", "value": ["admin", "owner"] }
  }
}
```

`$select` is required on every read node; fields outside `$select` are rejected.
`@meshql/client` accepts that object as `client.query(query, { entityId? })` —
no separate selection / controls arguments.

### 2.3 Catch-all resolver

`packages/core/src/resolver/registry.ts`:

```ts
class ResolverRegistry {
  register(entity: string | "*", resolver: Resolver): void;
  get(entity: string): Resolver | undefined; // returns specific then falls back to "*"
}
```

Behaviour:

- A specific entity resolver always wins.
- `"*"` is the fallback for any entity that doesn't have one.
- Registering `"*"` twice throws (deterministic ordering).

### 2.4 Resolver receives `list`

Already covered by adding it to `JoinPlan`. Update `Resolver` JSDoc with an
example showing list/filter/order usage.

### 2.5 Postgres helper learns list options

`packages/postgres/src/builder.ts`:

- Build parameterised `WHERE` from filters.
- Build `ORDER BY` from `orderBy`.
- Build `LIMIT` from `list.limit` (cap at 200).
- Decode cursor → add `WHERE id > $cursor` to the WHERE.
- Encode cursor when returning results (caller's responsibility, expose a
  helper).

Cursor format: `base64url(JSON.stringify({ id }))`. Resolver decides what's in
the cursor.

### 2.6 Tests ✅

`packages/core/src/parser/parser.test.ts`:

- Each filter operator parses correctly.
- Unknown operator → `ParseError`.
- `orderBy` parses multi-key with mixed directions.
- `limit` shape validation.

`packages/core/src/resolver/registry.test.ts`:

- Catch-all fires when no specific resolver registered.
- Specific resolver wins over catch-all.
- Double-registration of `"*"` throws.

`packages/postgres/src/builder.test.ts`:

- Filter generates parameterised WHERE.
- Multi-key ORDER BY renders correctly.
- Cursor decoded into WHERE clause.
- Limit and cursor keyset predicate.

### Acceptance ✅

- Collection reads with signed JSON read controls work end-to-end against
  the express-postgres example and the SQLite integration suite.
- Catch-all resolver pattern shown in README.

**Release: 0.4.0**

---

## Phase 3 — Native uploads with multipart integrity (~2 weeks) ✅ IMPLEMENTED

> Make `@meshql/upload` actually work. File upload is in the original vision and
> needs to be signed end-to-end, not just at the JSON header level.
>
> **What landed:**
>
> - Real `local` storage; `s3` / `r2` adapters (peer-dep gated on AWS SDK).
> - `busboy` multipart parser in `@meshql/http`; upload routes on Express,
>   Fastify, Hono, and integrity Express router.
> - `mesh.executeUpload()` + `onUpload` plugin hook; integrity checks
>   `contentHash` in the signed wire payload against file bytes.
> - `client.upload({ entity, field, id?, file })` hashes and signs automatically.
> - `examples/express-postgres` avatar upload to `./uploads/`.
> - Unit tests for local storage, multipart, integrity, and `executeUpload`.
> - MinIO CI integration for S3 is deferred (adapter is ready; no service container yet).

### 3.1 Real storage adapters

Replace the stubs in `packages/upload/src/storage/`.

`packages/upload/src/storage/local.ts`:

- Write `file.buffer` to `${directory}/${key}` (mkdir -p as needed).
- Return the canonical key (caller may map to URL).
- `get` reads the file, `delete` unlinks.

`packages/upload/src/storage/s3.ts`:

- Use `@aws-sdk/client-s3` (peer dep so users only install if they use S3).
- `put` calls `PutObjectCommand`; supports content-type from `MeshFile.mimetype`.
- `get` returns a `Buffer` or a presigned URL (config flag).

`packages/upload/src/storage/r2.ts`:

- Cloudflare R2 is S3-compatible — wrap the S3 adapter with an R2-specific
  endpoint config.

Each adapter is a separate file with its own tests. Local is required;
S3 and R2 are peer-dep gated.

### 3.2 Multipart parsing in HTTP adapters

`packages/http/src/transport/multipart.ts`:

- Use `busboy` (small, zero deps in its own right) to stream-parse
  `multipart/form-data`.
- One file part → `MeshFile { buffer, mimetype, originalName, size }`.
- One optional JSON metadata part named `meta` → merged into the resolver
  context.
- Reject early on `Content-Length` > configurable max (default 25 MB).

Wire into Express adapter as middleware on the upload routes.
Add Fastify and Hono ports for parity (each framework has its own multipart
parser; pick the lightest path).

### 3.3 Upload routes

Convention:

```
POST /api/:entity/:id/:field        (attach file to existing record)
POST /api/:entity                    (create record with attached file)
```

`packages/core/src/resolver/registry.ts` already has `registerUpload(path, fn)`.
Tighten the contract:

```ts
type UploadKey = `${string}.${string}`;     // "user.avatar"

interface UploadResolver {
  (file: MeshFile, plan: JoinPlan): Promise<Record<string, unknown>>;
}
```

The path `"user.avatar"` means "uploads to entity `user`, field `avatar`."

### 3.4 Multipart integrity

This is the new contract:

- The signed `X-Mesh-Query` header includes a `contentHash` field for upload
  requests:

  ```json
  { "user": { "avatar": { "upload": true } }, "contentHash": "sha256:..." }
  ```

- The server hashes the received multipart body (file bytes only, not headers)
  during streaming.
- After parsing, the server compares to the hash in the signed payload.
  Mismatch → `IntegrityError`, 401.

This keeps integrity stateless and works with the existing HMAC signing flow.

`packages/integrity/src/plugin.ts` gets an `onUpload` hook (new lifecycle stage)
that runs after parsing but before the upload resolver.

`packages/core/src/plugin/types.ts`: add the hook.

### 3.5 Client SDK uploads

`packages/client/src/client.ts`:

```ts
await client.upload({
  entity: "user",
  id: "123",
  field: "avatar",
  file,          // browser File or Node Buffer + filename
});
```

The client hashes the file (Web Crypto in browser, `node:crypto` in Node),
builds the signed query payload including `contentHash`, then sends multipart.

### 3.6 Tests

`packages/upload/test/local.test.ts`:

- Round-trip a file through local storage.
- Reject oversized file.

`packages/upload/test/s3.integration.test.ts`:

- Round-trip against [MinIO](https://min.io) (S3-compatible, runs in Docker).
- CI service container.

`packages/http/test/multipart.test.ts`:

- Parse single-file multipart.
- Parse with metadata.
- Reject oversize.

`packages/integrity/test/multipart.test.ts`:

- Tampered file body → `IntegrityError`.
- Wrong `contentHash` in signed payload → `IntegrityError`.
- Valid signed upload → resolver receives `MeshFile`.

`packages/client/test/upload.test.ts`:

- End-to-end via a test server.

### Acceptance

- `examples/express-postgres` gains an `avatar` upload route that writes to
  `./uploads/` and stores the path on the user record.
- Tampering the file body returns 401.
- S3 integration test green in CI (MinIO).
- Client SDK uploads from both Node and a browser test (Playwright optional).

**Release: 0.4.0**

---

## Phase 4 — ORM adapters (Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely) (2 weeks)

> The headline unlock. After this, users don't write resolvers by hand for
> common cases.

### 4.1 Preshaped resolver contract

ORM adapters return already-nested data — the shaper should pass it through
instead of flattening and re-nesting. Add an opt-in to the resolver registration:

```ts
mesh.resolve("user", fn, { preshaped: true });
mesh.resolve("*",   prismaResolver(prisma)); // implicitly preshaped
```

Internally:

- If `preshaped: true`, skip `shape()` / `shapeMany()` and pass the resolver's
  return value straight through (after `runOnResult` and `runOnResponse`).
- Type the return value as `Record<string, unknown> | Record<string, unknown>[]`.

This is additive — existing flat-row resolvers keep working.

### 4.2 `meshql-prisma`

New package `packages/prisma/`.

```ts
import { prismaResolver } from "meshql-prisma";
mesh.resolve("*", prismaResolver(prisma));
```

Implementation outline:

```ts
export function prismaResolver(client: PrismaClient): Resolver {
  return async (plan) => {
    const model = (client as any)[plan.rootEntity];

    const select = buildSelect(plan);   // { id: true, tokens: { select: { ... } } }
    const where  = buildWhere(plan);    // from list.filter + context.entityId
    const orderBy = buildOrderBy(plan); // from list.orderBy
    const take   = plan.list?.limit ?? 50;
    const cursor = plan.list?.cursor
      ? { id: decodeCursor(plan.list.cursor) }
      : undefined;

    if (plan.context.entityId !== undefined) {
      return model.findUnique({ where: { id: plan.context.entityId }, select });
    }
    return model.findMany({ select, where, orderBy, take, cursor, skip: cursor ? 1 : 0 });
  };
}
```

Mapping details:

- `plan.fields` (`users.id`, `users.name`) → Prisma `select`.
- `plan.joins[].refName` → Prisma include via `select.{refName}.select`.
- `EntityConfig.columns` maps MeshQL field name → Prisma field name when they
  differ.
- Filter ops: `eq → equals`, `in → in`, `gte → gte`, `like → contains`, etc.

### 4.3 `meshql-drizzle`

Same shape, against Drizzle's relational query builder.

```ts
import { drizzleResolver } from "meshql-drizzle";
import { db, schema } from "./db";

mesh.resolve("*", drizzleResolver(db, schema));
```

Drizzle's `db.query.users.findMany({ with: { tokens: true } })` maps cleanly to
the JoinPlan.

### 4.4 `meshql-kysely`

Lower-level: emit raw SQL via Kysely's expression builder. For users who
explicitly don't want an ORM but want type-safe SQL. Returns flat rows; the
shaper still runs (not preshaped).

Effectively a generalisation of `@meshql/postgres` that also supports MySQL and
SQLite via Kysely's dialect system.

### 4.5 Tests

Each adapter:

- Unit tests for plan → query mapping (no real DB).
- Integration tests against the real DB (Prisma → Postgres + SQLite; Drizzle →
  Postgres; Kysely → Postgres).
- Same query, three adapters, same response (consistency suite).

### 4.6 Demo

Add `examples/express-prisma/`:

- Schema: blog (users, posts, comments, tags).
- One MeshQL config, one resolver line, full CRUD via the routes.
- Reuse the integrity demo: signed queries, role-gated fields.

### Acceptance

- `mesh.resolve("*", prismaResolver(prisma))` works for the blog schema with
  zero hand-written resolvers.
- Same for Drizzle.
- Consistency suite: identical responses from Prisma and Drizzle adapters on
  the same Postgres schema.

**Release: 0.5.0**

---

## Phase 5 — Schema inference from ORMs (1 week)

> Users don't write the MeshQL schema by hand. They import it from their ORM
> and override only what they need to hide or rename.

### 5.1 `schemaFromPrisma`

```ts
import { schemaFromPrisma } from "meshql-prisma";
const schema = await schemaFromPrisma("./prisma/schema.prisma");
```

Implementation: use [`@mrleebo/prisma-ast`](https://github.com/MrLeebo/prisma-ast)
(MIT, mature) to parse `schema.prisma`. Walk models:

- Each `model Foo { … }` → entity `foo`.
- Scalar fields → `fields`.
- Relation fields → `joins`.
  - `posts Post[]` → `many` join.
  - `author User` → `one` join.
- `@id` → `idField`.
- `@map("snake_case")` → `columns` entry.

### 5.2 `schemaFromDrizzle`

Drizzle's table objects are runtime values, no source parsing needed:

```ts
import { schemaFromDrizzle } from "meshql-drizzle";
import * as tables from "./db/schema";
import { relations } from "./db/relations";
const schema = schemaFromDrizzle(tables, relations);
```

Walk each table's columns and relation config.

### 5.3 Override / extend mechanism

```ts
import { extendSchema } from "meshql-core";

const schema = extendSchema(
  await schemaFromPrisma("./prisma/schema.prisma"),
  {
    entities: {
      user: { fields: ["id", "name"] },          // hide email, role
    },
    joins: {
      "user.publicPosts": {                       // add custom join
        entity: "post",
        on: "posts.user_id = users.id AND posts.public = true",
        type: "many",
      },
    },
  },
);
```

`extendSchema` shallow-merges with the override taking precedence per entity.
Field arrays are *replaced* not concatenated — so users can explicitly hide.

### 5.4 Tests

`packages/prisma/test/schema-from-prisma.test.ts`:

- Fixture `schema.prisma` files with progressively richer features:
  - flat scalar fields
  - `@map` directives
  - one-to-many relation
  - many-to-many relation (junction table) — implicit Prisma M2M via `JoinConfig.through`
  - composite primary keys (decide: reject, or pick first id?)
- Each fixture → expected `MeshSchema` snapshot.

`packages/drizzle/test/schema-from-drizzle.test.ts`:

- Same coverage against Drizzle table objects.

`packages/core/test/extend-schema.test.ts`:

- Field hiding works.
- Custom join addition works.
- Original schema not mutated.

### 5.5 End-to-end demo

Update `examples/express-prisma/` to use `schemaFromPrisma` instead of the
hand-written schema. The MeshQL config is now:

```ts
const schema = await schemaFromPrisma("./prisma/schema.prisma");
const mesh = createMesh(schema);
mesh.resolve("*", prismaResolver(prisma));
```

Three lines.

### Acceptance

- A 50-line `schema.prisma` becomes a usable `MeshSchema` in one line.
- Field hiding via `extendSchema` works without breaking the resolver.
- Blog demo uses inferred schema and still passes its end-to-end tests.

**Release: 0.7.0** — schema inference from ORMs. Completes the original
“ten-line Express + Prisma” vision from the top of this document.

---

## Slice B — Shaper performance (2 evenings) ✅ DONE

> Cartesian fanout from multiple `many` joins made `shapeRefMany` O(N²).
> Realistic nested queries (100 comments × 20 tags) blocked the event loop.

### B.1 O(N) grouping in `shapeRefMany`

Replace outer-loop + `rows.filter(...)` with a single-pass
`Map<idValue, Row[]>`. Preserve insertion-ordered dedup semantics.

### B.2 `makeFieldReader` for hot loops

Closure factory that pre-computes candidate SQL aliases once and caches
the first hit per reader instance. Used in `shapeMany` root grouping
and `shapeRefMany` child grouping.

### B.3 Regression pins + measurement script

Eight high-fanout shaper tests. `packages/core/scripts/measure-shaper.mjs`
as a throwaway benchmark seed (not wired to CI).

### Acceptance

- Byte-identical response shapes vs 0.7.0.
- ~45–138× median speedup on single-parent heavy fanout (see CHANGELOG).
- All shaper tests pass.

**Release: 0.7.1**

Also shipped in 0.7.1: explicit rejection of cross-entity `list.filter` /
`list.orderBy` field paths (spec + validator).

---

## Phase 6 — `@meshql/docs` interactive playground (~4 weeks)

> Like Swagger UI or GraphQL Playground — but for MeshQL. Auto-generates from
> the user's existing schema. Zero extra config beyond one line.

### 6.1 Core prerequisites

Small additive changes in `@meshql/core` (needed by docs and computed):

```ts
// PluginContext — attach plan after buildJoinPlan
interface PluginContext {
  plan?: JoinPlan;
  // ...existing
}

// ExecuteOptions — optional SQL trace
interface ExecuteOptions {
  trace?: { sql?: boolean };
}
```

Postgres/sqlite resolvers: when `trace.sql` is set, collect `{ sql, params }`
from `buildSelectSql()`. ORM adapters return `sql: null` with a note. Docs
reads `meta.sql` only when `sql: "dev"`.

### 6.2 Package layout

```
packages/docs/
  src/
    index.ts              # withDocs, createDocsHandler
    introspection.ts      # buildSchemaDoc(mesh) → SchemaDoc
    execute-proxy.ts      # POST /docs/execute
    http.ts               # composite handler (pattern: persisted-queries)
    adapters/             # express, fastify, hono
  ui/                     # Vite SPA (Preact or vanilla; target <150KB gzipped)
  dist/ui/                # built assets (CI build step)
```

Follow composite-handler pattern from `@meshql/persisted-queries`:
`createDocsHandler(mesh)` routes `/docs/*` to static UI + schema + execute;
delegates everything else to `createHttpHandler(mesh)`.

### 6.3 Schema introspection (`buildSchemaDoc`)

Transform `mesh.schema` into playground-friendly JSON:

```ts
interface SchemaDoc {
  entities: Array<{
    name: string;
    fields: Array<{ name: string; kind: "scalar" | "computed"; type?: string }>;
    joins: Array<{ name: string; entity: string; type: "one" | "many" }>;
    listCapable: boolean;
  }>;
}
```

Not part of the MeshQL query language — explicit HTTP route only.

### 6.4 Playground UI

**Left panel:** entity browser → click entity → fields + joins → click fields
to build query → generated query shown in real time (reuse `@meshql/client`
`queryToJson` / `queryToQl`).

**Right panel:** run query → real response → duration → join plan visualization
→ SQL panel (dev mode).

Reuse `@meshql/http` `decodeQuery` / `encodeQuery` for wire format toggle.

### 6.5 Tasks (checklist)

- [x] Core: `PluginContext.plan`
- [x] Core: `ExecuteOptions.trace` + postgres/sqlite collector
- [x] `buildSchemaDoc` + `GET /docs/schema`
- [x] `POST /docs/execute` with `{ data, meta }` envelope
- [x] `createDocsHandler` composite router
- [x] Playground UI v1 (entity browser, query builder, response panel)
- [x] SQL trace panel (`sql: "dev"`)
- [x] Express adapter
- [x] `withDocs(mesh, options)` convenience wrapper
- [x] Showcase `/docs` integration
- [x] Unit tests: introspection, execute proxy, auth gate
- [x] E2E test: showcase hits `/docs/schema` and `/docs/execute`
- [x] Docs site: package page + guide
- [x] `docs/PUBLIC_API.md` entry for `@meshql/docs`

### 6.6 Acceptance

- `withDocs(mesh, { path: "/docs" })` serves a working playground in ≤10 lines
  of app code.
- Entity browser shows all entities, fields, and joins from `mesh.schema`.
- Click-to-build query generates valid MeshQL; Run returns real data.
- With `sql: "dev"`, response panel shows SQL + params for postgres/sqlite resolvers.
- Access control applies: playground runs as the authenticated user, not god mode.
- `auth: false` warns in production.

**Release: 0.10.0**

---

## Phase 7 — `@meshql/computed` virtual fields (~3.5 weeks)

> Virtual fields computed on the fly from real DB columns. Client never sees
> source fields unless explicitly requested.

### 7.1 Schema extension

```ts
interface ComputedFieldDef {
  from: string[];                              // "firstName" or "customer.firstName"
  compute: (...values: unknown[]) => unknown;
  access?: (ctx: QueryContext) => boolean;
  entity?: string;                           // cross-entity join signal
  type?: "string" | "number" | "boolean";     // for introspection / docs
}

interface EntityConfig {
  fields: string[];                          // includes computed names
  computed?: Record<string, ComputedFieldDef>;
  // ...existing
}
```

### 7.2 Planner changes (`buildJoinPlan`)

For each requested field in `entity.computed`:

1. Add to `plan.computedFields` (new array on `JoinPlan`)
2. Expand `from` deps into `plan.fields` (with join expansion for dotted paths)
3. Do **not** add computed name to SQL fields
4. Cross-entity `from: ["customer.firstName"]` → ensure customer join in plan

`validateAst`: computed fields pass like normal scalars through the entity's
`computed` map; they are not listed among physical `fields`.
`stripFieldsFromPlan`: deny computed field → strip deps too.

### 7.3 Compute execution

Core applies requested computed fields after resolver execution:

```
resolver → onResult (inject computed into flat rows) → shaper → onResponse
```

For preshaped ORM path (`preshaped: true`): compute after resolver, walk
nested structure matching AST.

Strip source fields (`firstName`, `lastName`) from response when client only
asked for `fullName`.

### 7.4 Tasks (checklist)

- [ ] Remove `EntityConfig.type` from `@meshql/core` and `extendSchema`
- [ ] Remove `type: {}` / `type: {} as T` from generated schemas, tests, examples, and docs
- [ ] Add migration note: delete the placeholder; TypeScript types do not coerce DB values at runtime
- [x] `ComputedFieldDef` type in `@meshql/core` schema
- [x] `JoinPlan.computedFields` + planner dep expansion
- [x] `validateAst` allows computed field names
- [x] `stripFieldsFromPlan` handles computed + deps
- [x] Keep computed fields schema-native (no separate package)
- [x] Flat-row compute + source stripping in core execution
- [x] Access: denied computed → planner strip (deps never fetched)
- [x] Cross-entity computed with implicit join
- [x] Prisma/Drizzle preshaped path
- [x] Reject computed→computed at registration
- [x] Reject computed in `$where`; document other controls as physical-only
- [x] Computed field behavior documented in `specs/08-computed-fields.md`
- [x] `@meshql/docs` integration: `kind: "computed"` + runtime type hint
- [ ] Playground tooltip for `from` dependencies

### 7.5 Acceptance

- `{ user { fullName } }` where `fullName` is computed from `firstName` +
  `lastName` returns `{ fullName: "John Doe" }` without exposing source fields.
- SQL plan includes `first_name, last_name`; does not SELECT a `full_name` column.
- Access-denied computed field never fetches source columns.
- Cross-entity `customerFullName` auto-joins `customer` when needed.
- Playground shows computed fields with tooltip (`from` deps) and SQL panel
  shows underlying columns.

**Release: 0.11.0**

---

## After Phase 5 — what's left for v1.0

Phases 0–5 plus docs/specs landed the ORM-driven core. The **v0.8 → v1.0**
track above is now the source of truth. Summary of what remains:

| Area | Status | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Documentation + protocol specs | ✅ done | — |
| Showcase + express-prisma demos | ✅ done | — |
| Production wire protocol (persisted queries) | ✅ done | 0.8.0 |
| Access cache + core test coverage | ✅ done | 0.8.0 |
| Real-time (SSE + pubsub) + gateway + codemods | ✅ done | 0.9.0 |
| Interactive playground (`@meshql/docs`) | ✅ ready to release | 0.10.0 |
| Computed fields (in `@meshql/core`) | ✅ implemented + documented | 0.11.0 |
| Benchmarks, auth adapters, npm org, Go port, integrity audit | 📋 | 1.0.0 |
| API audit + security pass | 📋 | 0.9.0 (prep) / 1.0.0 (freeze) |
| Schema naming polish + stale README fixes | ✅ | this week |

See **v0.10.0**, **v0.11.0**, and **v1.0.0** at the top of this doc
for the prioritized checklist.

---

## Cross-cutting concerns

### Testing strategy

Every phase adds tests at three levels:

| Level | Tool | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | vitest | `packages/*/src/*.test.ts` |
| Integration (DB) | vitest + testcontainers / docker-compose | `packages/*/test/*.integration.test.ts` |
| End-to-end (HTTP) | vitest + supertest | `examples/*/test/*.e2e.test.ts` |

Unit tests run on every PR (`pnpm test`). Integration and e2e run on a
separate CI workflow that has Docker available.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` evolves through the plan:

- Phase 1: add Postgres 16 service container, run integration tests
- Phase 3: add MinIO service container for S3 tests
- Phase 4: add Prisma + SQLite for ORM coverage

Pin Node to 22 LTS; add 24 to the matrix in Phase 6.

### Documentation surface

| Doc | Created | Maintained from |
|---|---|---|
| Root README | exists | Phase 0 rewrite |
| `docs/run-example.md` | exists | Phase 5 rewrite (ORM inference) |
| `docs/http-adapters.md` | exists | Phase 2 (list params) |
| `docs/jsr-settings.md` | exists | as-is |
| `docs/integrity.md` | Phase 3 | signed multipart explained |
| `docs/orm-adapters.md` | Phase 4 | how to write a custom adapter |
| `docs/schema-inference.md` | Phase 5 | Prisma + Drizzle coverage |
| `docs/comparison.md` | post-Phase 5 | vs PostgREST, Hasura, hand-rolled |
| `docs/playground.md` | Phase 6 | `@meshql/docs` setup + security |
| `docs/computed-fields.md` | Phase 7 | virtual fields + access patterns |
| `specs/08-computed-fields.md` | Phase 7 | optional behavior contract |
| `ROADMAP.md` | this doc | maintained as phases close |

### Release process

Each phase ends with:

1. Run `pnpm changeset` for every package touched, classified
   (`patch` / `minor` / `major`).
2. `pnpm version-packages` to bump.
3. Tag the meta-release (e.g. `v0.2.0`).
4. `pnpm publish:jsr` and `pnpm publish:npm:pack`.
5. Draft GitHub release with a short summary and migration notes if any
   breaking changes.

### Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Multi-join correctness keeps surprising us | Property-based tests in Phase 1 (fast-check) over the shaper |
| Prisma / Drizzle internals change | Pin to current major; release patch versions on adapter breakage |
| Multipart integrity is subtle | Write tests *first* in Phase 3; treat the protocol as the spec |
| Plugin API drift before 1.0 | Document and freeze in the v1.0 phase |
| Schema inference doesn't cover edge cases | Ship explicit `extendSchema` from day one so users have an escape hatch |
| Playground exposes schema in production | Default `auth` required in prod; warn on `auth: false` |
| Computed field dep explosion | Cap `from` array length; reject computed→computed at registration |

## How to use this roadmap

- Treat phase boundaries as the only places where breaking changes ship.
  Inside a phase, prefer additive changes.
- Open one tracking issue per phase, with the tasks above as a checklist.
- If a phase grows beyond its estimate, split it. Don't let scope creep
  between phases — that's how 0.x libraries never reach 1.0.
- Re-read the Vision snippet at the top of this doc whenever a feature
  proposal arrives. If it doesn't make the snippet shorter, smarter, or
  more honest, push it to post-1.0.
